## Getting started
Before getting started please make sure you have all the above skills

Perform the following steps to start your contribution to our organization.
1. Fork this repository.
5. Now create a branch with name "your-name/feature/<name_of_the_feature>".
6. Now you can start implementing the feature once done push all the changes to the branch you have created and create a pull request to "review" branch.
7. Pull request will be reviewed and tested. Once it has been passed your features would be merged with the plugin.

Also if you implement any feature without consulting/informing any of the members your code won't be reviewed and accepted.

    If you have any doubts regarding above steps or you are having any trouble then you can contact 
    on slack(link below).
    

## Bug reporting

We appreciate your effort to improve inventory-management by submitting a bug report. Before doing so, please check the following things: 

1. Check whether the bug you face **hasn't been already reported**. Duplicate reports takes us time, that we could be used to fix other bugs or make improvements. 
3. If you got some error, please **describe what happened** and add error message. Reports like "I get error when I clicked on some link." are useless. 
Thanks for your help! 


## Patches submission

Patches are welcome as pull requests on GitHub. Please include a
Signed-off-by tag in the commit message (you can do this by passing `--signoff`
parameter to Git). 

When creating the commit on GitHub or using some other tool which does not have
direct support for this, it is the same as adding 
`Signed-off-by: Your name <email@example.com>`
as the last line of the commit message.

`Note that by submitting patches with the Signed-off-by tag, you are giving
permission to license the patch as GNU Liscense.`
